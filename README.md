## 🚀 Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher  
- MySQL Server installed and running  
- Eclipse IDE (with WindowBuilder plugin)

### 🧩 Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ArjunPatil15/Smart-Student-Staff-Management-System-.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project in Eclipse**
   - Use Eclipse IDE with WindowBuilder plugin enabled.
   - Import as a Java Project.

3. **Configure MySQL Database**
   - Import the provided `.sql` file (located in the `Database` folder of the repository) into your MySQL server.
   - Update your database connection details (username, password, database name, and URL) within the Java source code.
     This configuration is typically found in a dedicated database utility class or within the main application setup.

4. **Build and Run**
   - Ensure all project dependencies (like the MySQL Connector/J JAR file) are included in your project's build path. These are usually located in the `lib` folder.
   - Run the main application class, which typically contains the entry point for the login screen.
   - Test the login functionality with different user roles (student and staff) and verify the CRUD operations for both student and staff records.
